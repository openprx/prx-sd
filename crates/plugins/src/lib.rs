//! WASM plugin system for the prx-sd antivirus engine.
//!
//! Allows users to write custom detection/remediation plugins in any language
//! that compiles to WASM (Rust, Go, C, AssemblyScript, etc.).
//!
//! When compiled without the `wasm-runtime` feature the host and registry
//! are still available but every scan returns an empty result set and a
//! warning is logged.
